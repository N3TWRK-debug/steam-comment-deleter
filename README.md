# Steam Comment Deletion Script

This script is designed to automatically delete comments from a specific Steam user on a Steam profile page.

## How It Works
- The script searches for comments made by a specific Steam user (identified by their Steam ID) and deletes them.
- It uses the user's Steam ID, which you can input in the script, and looks for the delete button associated with their comments.

## Usage
1. Open the Steam profile page containing the comments you want to delete.
2. Open the browser's developer tools (press `F12` or right-click and select "Inspect").
3. Go to the "Console" tab and paste the script into the console.
4. Replace `userIdToRemove` with the Steam ID of the user whose comments you want to delete.
5. Run the script.

Important: Use this script responsibly and ensure it complies with Steam's Terms of Service. Do not use this for malicious purposes or abuse.
